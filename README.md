- easy to setup the project, similar to using other frameworks we have touched on like vue and nuxt
- using react icons (w easy instal in command line) is nice and simple, syntax to link them was easy, ex: <BsFillMoonStarsFill />
- using span to wrap text and style seperately with tailwind (see:lorem20 under services)
- Importing images in react was suprisingly simple as well
- leared about importing use states with ```import {useState} from "react";``` for dark mode functionallity
- learned about building a use state with ```const [darkMode, setDarkMode] = useState(false);```
- added state, darkmode toggle, change each element to a dark stlying in tailwind ex: dark:bg-gray-900
